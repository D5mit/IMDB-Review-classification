# IMDB-Review-classification
Classify the review of IMDB movies as either positive or negative. 

A neural network was trained with data from IMDB reviews. The model accuracy against test data was 85%. This is good, but not perfect, notee that the neural network does not take into consideration the sequence of words.  If the review was very short and as a result of the word order, the sentiment might be misunderstood.  For example: 'the terrible movie was awesome'. 

#to do - a Flask app to untilize the model. 
#to do - look at a recurrent neural network to improve on the problem described above.
